% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%

\section{Research}
\runsubsection{F-NSGA III: An Improved Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm for Appropriate Software Architecture Considering Maintenance and Security Related Metrics}
\descript{| Undergrad Thesis}
I proposed some improvement on measuring metrics of modularity, reusability, performance of software architecture, and adapted some security related metrics  to this context. Using many-objective optimization algorithms: NSGA-III, I proposed an approach to suggest some possible options by optimizing these contradictory these metrics of a software architecture. I have proposed some special  improvement on NSGA-III in this context  using domain knowledge.
